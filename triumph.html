				<h2>"What happened at Hiroshima was not only that a scientific breakthrough … had occurred and that a great part of the population of a city had been burned to death, but that the problem of the relation of the triumphs of modern science to the human purposes of man had been explicitly defined."</h2>

					<p><center>The Atomic Age or also called the Atomic Era formally began when Albert Einstein wrote a letter to president, Franklin Roosevelt. The world’s most celebrated scientist warned the president that it might be “possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power would be generated.” This “new phenomenon” he said, could lead to “extremely powerful bombs of a new type.” He urged to make something capable to withstand the Germans. President, Franklin D. Roosevelt immedietly after reading the letter by Einstein, authorized a Advisory Committee on Uranium.</center></p>
